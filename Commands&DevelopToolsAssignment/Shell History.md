10. When is command history written to the history file ?
	The history command simply provides a list of previously used commands. Thatâ€™s all that is saved in the history file. For bash users, this information all gets stuffed into the .bash_history file; for other shells, it might be just .history.
When you enter command "history" then that command got written into history file.
